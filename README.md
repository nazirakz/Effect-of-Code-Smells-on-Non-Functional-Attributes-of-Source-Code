# Effect-of-Code-Smells-on-Non-Functional-Attributes-of-Source-Code
Repository for Software Dependability Class @ Unisa
With this project we want to investigate how, and how much these code smells
impact on a system, and which are their eects on non-functional requirements.
It is really worth to invest on research about code smell for a company? And
again, mayor developer companies are really interested about code smells? In
order to achieve our goal, we will review many scientic research and surveys in
literature and try to answer to our questions.
